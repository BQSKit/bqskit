    "# Using Partitioning to Optimize a Circuit\n",
    "\n",
    "Synthesis is a very powerful circuit optimization technique. However, the input size to even QFAST doesn't scale to larger circuits well. In fact, to be able to synthesize a circuit currently, we will need to be able to simulate it. This will ultimately cap the scaling of synthesis algorithms. However, we can still use a synthesis tool together with partitioner to optimize small blocks of a circuit at a time. BQSKit was designed for this exact use case and in this guide, we will explore how to accomplish this. It is recommended that you read the other tutorials first."
