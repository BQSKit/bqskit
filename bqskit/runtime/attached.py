    BQSKit Runtime Server in attached mode.

    In attached mode, the runtime is started by the client. The client owns the
    server and there is only one client on the server. Additionally, the client
    is responsible for shutting down the server. There are no managers in the
    attached architecture, only workers directly managed by a single server.
    This architecture is designed for single-machine shared-memory settings.
    BQSKit will, by default, create, manage, and shutdown an AttachedServer when
    a :class:`~bqskit.compiler.compiler.Compiler` object is created.
