Welcome to BQSKit's documentation!
==================================

The Berkeley Quantum Synthesis Toolkit (BQSKit) \[bis • kit\] is a
powerful and portable quantum compiler framework. It can be used with
ease to compile quantum programs to efficient physical circuits for any
QPU. BQSKit achieves its superior portability by utilizing a novel
quantum circuit intermediate representation designed to facilitate
numerical instantiation. On top of this IR, we built an algorithm
framework and compiler infrastructure to efficiently accomplish any
quantum compilation goal. You will find some guides and API documentation
below, and you can learn how to use BQSKit to solve your problems with
our `tutorial series. <https://github.com/BQSKit/bqskit-tutorial/>`_
