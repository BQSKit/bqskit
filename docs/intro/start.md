# Getting Started

The Berkeley Quantum Synthesis Toolkit (BQSKit) \[bis â€¢ kit\] is a powerful
and portable quantum compiler framework. It can be used with ease to compile
quantum programs to efficient physical circuits for any QPU.

## Installation

BQSKit is available for Python 3.8+ on Linux, macOS, and Windows. BQSKit
and its dependencies are listed on the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org),
and as such, pip can easily install it:

```sh
pip install bqskit
```

## Basic Usage

A standard BQSKit workflow loads a program into the framework, models the
target QPU, compiles the program, and exports the resulting circuit. The
below example uses BQSKit to optimize an input circuit provided by a qasm
file:

```python
from bqskit import compile, Circuit

# Load a circuit from QASM
circuit = Circuit.from_file("input.qasm")

# Compile the circuit
compiled_circuit = compile(circuit)

# Save output as QASM
compiled_circuit.save("output.qasm")
```

To learn more about BQSKit, follow the
[tutorial series](https://github.com/BQSKit/bqskit-tutorial/) or refer to
the [documentation](https://bqskit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## How to Cite

You can use the [software disclosure](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1785933)
to cite the BQSKit package.

Additionally, if you used or extended a specific algorithm, you should cite
that individually. BQSKit passes will include a relevant reference in
their documentation.
